# 3ds-vgmstream
[vgmstream](http://hcs64.com/vgmstream.html) authored by hcs is a library for playing a wide variety of streamed audio formats used in video games.

3ds-vgmstream is a port of the above library with a simple player (for now) utilizing the library.

## Usage
1. Extract the archive from releases to your sd card
2. Place any tested file formats in the music directory on your sd card.
3. When the app is opened you are presented with a list of the files it found in the music folder.  Select one and press A.
4. The music will start playing press B to choose something else to play and START to exit.

## Supported and Tested Formats
* .strm
* .brstm
* .bcstm

## Theoretically Playable Formats 
A list of all formats that are supported by vgmstream can be found here [kode54/vgmstream](https://github.com/kode54/vgmstream)

And note that while vgmstream supports those formats, this doesn't mean it will load correctly on the 3ds! Some tweaks of vgmstream need to be made to have it work on the 3ds.

If you find that a file format doesn't work then please comment the file format in this [issue](https://github.com/TricksterGuy/3ds-vgmstream/issues/3)
